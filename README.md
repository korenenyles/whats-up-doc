Bug Tracker built with Django


    requires logging in, but people who aren't logged in cannot create accounts (don't want any random person to see bugs in your application!)
    use a custom user model to replace the built-in one (you may want to reference üë®‚Äçüî¨ Under the Microscope: Custom Users)
    has a homepage that shows all tickets, arranged in separate columns according to current ticket status (i.e. New, In Progress, Done, Invalid)
    allows filing/creating tickets
    has a ticket detail page
    allows assigning a ticket to the currently logged in user
    allows marking a ticket as invalid
    allows marking a ticket as complete
    allows editing tickets (we will limit this to Title and Description, do not include other any of the other fields)
    has a user detail page where you can see:
        the current tickets assigned to a user
        which tickets that user has filed
        which tickets that user completed
